# slithergram

Here's where I will re-word the description that's up at the top. Or just leave
it like this, since it's kinda funny, if you ask me.

It's guaranteed to work with Python 3.5+, but it'll most likely  work with any
Python 3. It might even work with Python 2, I'll check another time.


## Requirements

Probably it doesn't actually _require_ exactly the versions I list, but they're
the versions I'm using while working on it, and I don't feel like doing a whole
bunch of investigating. Maybe later.

[requests] 2.8.1

## Getting Started

I'll fill this in with a tutorial eventually, or I might just leave it to the
documentation. Speaking of documentation...


## Documentation

No such thing, at the moment. But I'll add such a thing, and it'll use Sphinx.
