# Slithergram 0.0.2

Here's where I will re-word the description that's up at the top. Or just leave
it like this, since it's kinda funny, if you ask me.

## Python Version

It's guaranteed to work with Python 3.5+, but it'll most likely  work with any
Python 3. It might even work with Python 2, I'll check another time. But if it
doesn't work as it is, I'm probably not going to bother trying to make it.

As much as I'd like everyone to be able to use this, I just can't justify, to
myself, doing anything to support the continued use of Python 2. I understand
that you sometimes have no choice, because you need to use some old, probably
abandoned module, but if that's the case for you, and you really wanna use this
specific module for some reason, I doubt it could be that hard to fork it and
fix the incompatibilities yourself.

But I'd just suggest you use one of the [other][] [Telegram][] [modules][].

## Documentation

The source for the documentation can be found in the docs folder. It's pretty
much blank right now, but there nevertheless. When it's a little more complete,
I'll stick it on [readthedocs.org][rtd]

### Requirements

Probably it doesn't actually _require_ exactly the versions I list, but they're
the versions I'm using while working on it, and I don't feel like doing a whole
bunch of investigating. Maybe later.

[requests][] 2.8.1

### Getting Started

I'll fill this in with a tutorial eventually, or maybe not. If I do, I imagine
it'll be a copy of the tutorial that will be in the documentation. If I add a
tutorial there.
